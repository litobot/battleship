# Computer and Player both duplicate @cells for their own use

# Computer fires randomly generated shot
  # This does 2 things:

#(1).
  # Shots fired must render changes on original gameboard (@cells) as "H", "X", "M", etc.

#(2).
  # Keys from generated coordinates are stored in a separate hash to track shots fired
  # Subsequent shots must be unique from those stored in array
  # Must check respective shot_fired array in order to fire unique shot from cell hash

# Game Over empties shots_fired array for new game
